        Thought I’d help you out there…now that we’ve got that out of the way…More About Me. I’m among the few that was born and raised in Seattle. From the mini guessing game, you now know that I love movies, travel, food and that I work out so that I can eat more food. I also went to culinary school…do you see a theme yet?</p>

            My career has been mostly in the hospitality industry at hotels and restaurants. That career choice allowed me to do my favorite past time. Travel, eat, see music shows and art galleries around the world.</p>

                I've been involded with technology for most of my career. I have only been involved at a high level; which is code (haha get it?...code) for knowing enough to break stuff, fix it and sometimes know how I fixed it. I'm looking forward to knowing how I fix things. So I'm excited for the career pivot that is underway.</p>
